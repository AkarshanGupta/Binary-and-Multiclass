# Thoughts 
* This is just simple and basic notebook whhch contains how to create **Binary** and **Multi-Class Classification** with the help
  of sklearn inbuilt datasets.I have worked with **Pytorch** and python to do so.If you are beginner it will help you with understanding how to use
  pytorch framework and to implement deep learning.

  * Note - look in the code part the head point numbers are up and down.
